Dunkirk has been the scene of a number of significant historical events, including the famous evacuation of Allied troops during the Second World War. * Dunkirk has a rich historical heritage. You can explore the belfries: the belfries of Gravelines, Saint Eloi and Dunkirk town hall are all UNESCO World Heritage Sites. * Other Dunkirk museums worth visiting include the Dunkerque 1940 - Opération Dynamo museum, the Musée de la mer, the Jean Bart construction site, the Palais de l'Univers et des Sciences and the LAAC (Lieu d'art et d'Action contemporaine). STROLL THROUGH DUNKIRK CITY CENTRE. Although we have already touched on this subject a little earlier, Dunkirk is above all a city marked by history.

      "Question: What are the treatments for Antisynthetase syndrome ?. Answer: What treatment is available for antisynthetase syndrome? Corticosteroids are typically the first-line of treatment and may be required for several months or years. These medications are often given orally; however, in severe cases, intravenous methylprednisolone may be prescribe initially. Immunosuppressive medications may also be recommended, especially in people with severe muscle weakness or symptomatic interstitial lung disease. Physical therapy is often necessary to improve weakness, reduce further muscle wasting from disuse, and prevent muscle contractures.. Type: treatment. \n",
      "Question: What are the treatments for Orthostatic Hypotension ?. Answer: When orthostatic hypotension is caused by hypovolemia due to medications, the disorder may be reversed by adjusting the dosage or by discontinuing the medication. When the condition is caused by prolonged bed rest, improvement may occur by sitting up with increasing frequency each day. In some cases, physical counterpressure such as elastic hose or whole-body inflatable suits may be required. Dehydration is treated with salt and fluids.
